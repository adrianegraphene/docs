## current IP ownership

presently, intellectual property is held by **RoboCash Inc.**, a Delaware C-Corporation (FynCom is the "Doing Business As" name in California).

this fundraising creates a clear path to transfer appropriate IP to the DAO while maintaining strategic flexibility.

## immediate transfers (month 0)

these assets will transfer to the DAO immediately upon successful fundraising close:

## post-fundraise roadmap

certain IP requires thoughtful transition planning to maximize value and maintain strategic optionality:

### patent: US 11,310,368 B2

the core patent protecting FynCom's Time-Based Nano-Transaction System requires careful strategy:

<Steps>
  <Step title="months 1-3: evaluation period">
    **activities**: - legal counsel review patent transfer implications -
    evaluate VC compatibility if patent remains with RoboCash Inc. - assess
    licensing vs. outright transfer options - DAO discussion on preferred
    approach **considerations**: - patent currently grants competitive
    protection - VC fundraising may require patent in traditional corporate
    structure - DAO needs patent protection benefits regardless of ownership
    structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="months 3-6: strategy finalization">
    **options under consideration**: **option A: exclusive perpetual license** -
    patent remains with RoboCash Inc. - DAO receives exclusive, royalty-free,
    perpetual license - allows future VC fundraising if needed - DAO has full
    operational use of patented technology **option B: full transfer to DAO** -
    patent assigned to DAO entity - eliminates any future VC path for RoboCash
    Inc. - clearest alignment with DAO ownership - requires legal entity
    structuring for DAO **option C: co-ownership** - patent jointly held by
    RoboCash Inc. and DAO - both parties can use and license - maintains
    flexibility while sharing value - complex legal structure **DAO vote**:
    governance decision on preferred structure
  </Step>
  <Step title="months 6-9: legal execution">
    **implementation**: - draft and execute chosen legal structure - file
    necessary patent office paperwork - establish licensing terms (if
    applicable) - document rights and obligations clearly **transparency**: all
    legal documents published to DAO
  </Step>
  <Step title="months 9-12: operations">
    **ongoing**: - patent maintenance fees (DAO budgeted) - defensive
    enforcement if needed - licensing opportunities to partners - international
    patent strategy (if warranted)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### patent details

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="patent information">
    **patent number**: US 11,310,368 B2 **title**: "Time-Based Nano-Transaction
    System for Reducing Unsolicited Communications" **issue date**: April 19,
    2022 **status**: active and maintained **coverage**: United States
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="key claims">
    **protected innovations**: - time-based refund mechanism for communication
    stakes - automated engagement measurement (call duration, message threads) -
    nano-transaction processing at scale - economic filtering of unwanted
    communications **strategic value**: prevents competitors from copying core
    mechanism
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="enforcement">
    **defensive use**: protects FynCom from patent trolls and competitors
    **offensive potential**: could license to other platforms or pursue
    infringement cases **DAO control**: governance decides enforcement strategy
    and licensing
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="expansion">
    **international**: could file in other jurisdictions if market expansion
    warrants **additional patents**: future innovations may merit additional
    patent applications **DAO decision**: governance approves IP expansion
    strategy
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## rationale for phased approach

transparency about why patent transfer is more complex than other assets:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="VC optionality" icon="building-columns">
    **consideration**: traditional VCs typically require patents in corporate
    structure **why it matters**: if DAO-funded phase succeeds but additional
    capital needed for massive scale, VC might be optimal **solution**:
    exclusive license gives DAO full benefits while maintaining VC path if ever
    needed
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="legal entity complexity" icon="scale-balanced">
    **consideration**: DAOs are evolving legal structures, patent law is
    traditional **why it matters**: patent offices and courts understand
    traditional entities better **solution**: phased approach allows proper
    legal structuring for patent holding
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="founder commitment" icon="handshake">
    **consideration**: patent represents years of innovation and legal work by
    founders **why it matters**: founders taking substantial risk with
    fundraise, want strategic flexibility **solution**: roadmap approach builds
    trust, allows evaluation period, ensures mutual benefit
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## backend open-sourcing evaluation

the backend codebase requires security-first decision making:

### considerations

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="pros of open source">
    **transparency**: full visibility into how system works **trust**: community
    can audit security and fairness **contributions**: potential for community
    improvements **alignment**: matches DAO ethos of openness
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="cons of open source">
    **security risk**: bad actors could study code to find vulnerabilities
    **gaming risk**: spammers could learn to circumvent detection **competitive
    risk**: competitors get free access to our innovations **maintenance**: open
    source requires community management
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### decision framework

<Steps>
  <Step title="security audit (months 1-3)">
    independent security review of backend to identify sensitive vs.
    safe-to-open-source components
  </Step>
  <Step title="selective open source (months 4-6)">
    open source non-sensitive components first (SDKs, client libraries,
    documentation)
  </Step>
  <Step title="DAO governance (months 6-9)">
    DAO votes on backend open source strategy with full security information
  </Step>
  <Step title="execution (months 9-12)">
    implement chosen approach with appropriate safeguards
  </Step>
</Steps>

## IP valuation

the transferred IP represents significant value:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="patent value" icon="certificate">
    **comparable IP**: similar telecom/fintech patents valued at $500K-$5M
    **strategic value**: provides 17+ years of competitive protection (from 2022
    issue date)
  </Card>
  <Card title="brand value" icon="trademark">
    **existing equity**: 500K+ transactions build brand recognition **market
    position**: first-mover in economic communication filtering
  </Card>
  <Card title="code value" icon="code">
    **development cost**: years of engineering work, proven at scale
    **operational value**: generating real revenue and real transactions
  </Card>
  <Card title="total estimate" icon="sack-dollar">
    **conservative**: $2-5M in IP value being transferred/licensed to DAO
    **upside**: could be worth much more if platform achieves market leadership
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## IP protection & management

ongoing IP strategy post-transfer:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="trademark registration" icon="trademark">
    **action**: file trademark applications for "FynCom" and "KarmaCall"
    **timing**: months 3-6 post-fundraise **jurisdiction**: US initially,
    international if warranted by expansion **budget**: included in
    legal/operations budget
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="additional patents" icon="lightbulb">
    **consideration**: new innovations (agentic AI negotiation, etc.) may merit
    patent protection **process**: DAO governance approves patent applications
    **cost**: $10-20K per patent application, factored into budget if pursued
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="defensive publications" icon="shield">
    **strategy**: publish certain innovations to create prior art, preventing
    competitors from patenting **benefit**: cheaper than patents, still provides
    protection **DAO decision**: balance patents vs. publications based on
    strategy
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="licensing opportunities" icon="file-contract">
    **potential**: license technology to other platforms for revenue
    **examples**: email providers, messaging apps, social platforms **DAO
    control**: governance approves all licensing deals and terms
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## transparency commitments

FynCom commits to full IP transparency with the DAO:

<Steps>
  <Step title="immediate disclosure">
    all IP assets, their status, and transfer timelines documented and published
  </Step>
  <Step title="monthly updates">
    progress reports on IP transfers, patent strategy, trademark applications
  </Step>
  <Step title="governance decisions">
    DAO votes on major IP decisions (patent transfer structure, open source,
    licensing)
  </Step>
