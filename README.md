# FynCom MetaDAO Fundraise Documentation

This repository contains the investor documentation for FynCom's MetaDAO fundraise. We're raising $1M to scale the economic trust layer for digital communication.

## About FynCom

FynCom creates digital trust by adding crypto into calls, texts, emails & DMs. We require unknown senders to stake a small refundable deposit before recipients are notified. This economic proof-of-intent filters spam while compensating recipients.
