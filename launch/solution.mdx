## The FynCom Protocol

FynCom solves the spam problem with **economic proof-of-intent**—a system where every communication from an unknown sender requires a small, refundable stake.

<Info>
  **Core Principle:** If communication costs nothing, spam thrives. If communication requires accountability, trust returns.
</Info>

## How It Works

### For Phone Calls

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unknown Caller Attempts Contact">
    An unknown number calls a FynCom user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake Required">
    The caller must stake **$0.05** to ring through. If they don't stake, the call is blocked (no notification to recipient).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Call Connects">
    If the recipient answers, the call proceeds normally.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Refund or Forfeit">
    - **Refund:** If the conversation lasts 25+ seconds, the caller gets their stake back automatically
    - **Forfeit:** If the call is shorter, the stake is forfeited (80% to recipient, 20% to treasury)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### For Messages (Text, Email, DMs)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Unknown Sender Attempts Contact">
    An unknown person sends a message to a FynCom user.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Stake Required">
    The sender must stake **$0.01** for the message to reach the recipient's inbox. Otherwise, it's filtered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Message Delivered">
    The recipient sees the message and can choose to engage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automatic Refund or Forfeit">
    - **Refund:** If there are 3+ thread responses, the sender gets their stake back automatically
    - **Forfeit:** If not, the stake is forfeited (80% to recipient, 20% to treasury)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why This Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Economic Barrier" icon="shield">
    Spam becomes unprofitable. A spammer sending 1M messages needs to stake $10,000—and loses most of it when recipients don't engage.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Self-Correcting" icon="arrows-rotate">
    No central authority needed. The economics automatically filter out bad actors while rewarding legitimate senders.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fair to Senders" icon="handshake">
    Legitimate senders get refunded. They lose nothing for good-faith communication. Only bad actors pay.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Fair to Recipients" icon="coins">
    Recipients get compensated for spam. Their attention becomes a valuable, tradeable asset.

## Advanced Features

### Premium Pricing

Recipients can set their own rates:
- Default: $0.05/call, $0.01/message
- Premium: Set higher rates based on your value of time
- Dynamic: Adjust rates based on time of day, sender location, etc.

**This creates a real marketplace for attention.**

### Custom Refund Criteria

Coming soon: Recipients can define their own refund conditions:
- Minimum call duration
- Number of message exchanges
- Specific keywords or topics
- Time-based rules

### Agentic AI Negotiation

The future: AI agents negotiate on your behalf:
- Your agent sets stake requirements
- Sender's agent evaluates and negotiates
- Automatic agreement on stake/refund terms
- Seamless human experience

## Real-World Example

### Scenario: Sales Outreach

**Traditional System:**
- Sales rep sends 1,000 cold emails
- Cost: $0
- Response rate: 2% (20 responses)
- Value to rep: High (potential deals)
- Cost to recipients: 1,000 people waste time filtering/deleting

**FynCom System:**
- Sales rep sends 1,000 cold emails
- Cost: $10 staked (1,000 × $0.01)
- Response rate: 2% (20 responses)
- Refund: $0.20 (20 × $0.01)
- Forfeit: $9.80
- Cost to rep: **$9.80** (only for non-responses)
- Value to recipients: **$7.84** (80% of forfeits distributed to 980 non-responders)
- Value to treasury: **$1.96** (20% of forfeits)

**Result:**
- Rep still reaches interested prospects (gets refunded)
- Non-interested recipients get compensated
- Treasury funds protocol development
- Everyone's incentives are aligned

## The Traction Proof

This isn't theory. FynCom has already completed:

<Tip>
  **Over 500,000 "cash-back" transactions** across calls, texts, and emails through our KarmaCall mobile app.
</Tip>

Users love it because:
- **Spam drops to near-zero** (spammers can't afford to stake)
- **Legitimate calls get through** (senders get refunded)
- **Recipients earn rewards** (getting paid to filter spam)

## Technical Architecture

### Blockchain Integration

FynCom uses **Solana** for:

const fyncom = new FynCom({ apiKey: 'your-key' });

// Require stake for incoming message
const result = await fyncom.requireStake({
  sender: 'unknown@example.com',
  amount: 0.01,
  refundCriteria: { minThreadLength: 3 }
});
```

```python Python
from fyncom import FynCom

fyncom = FynCom(api_key='your-key')

# Require stake for incoming message
result = fyncom.require_stake(
    sender='unknown@example.com',
    amount=0.01,
    refund_criteria={'min_thread_length': 3}
)
```
