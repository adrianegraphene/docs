## Token Overview

<Info>
  **Token Name:** FynCom

  **Ticker:** FynCom

  **Blockchain:** Solana (SPL Token)

  **Total Supply:** To be determined at ICO pricing
</Info>

## Performance Package Structure

The FynCom token includes a **10M token performance package** designed to align team incentives with long-term protocol success. Unlike traditional vesting schedules, these tokens unlock based on **price milestones**—not time.

### Unlock Schedule

<Steps>
  <Step title="2x ICO Price: 2M Tokens">
    **First Milestone**

    Requires sustained value creation and market confidence. Expected timing: Months 6-8 post-raise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="4x ICO Price: 2M Tokens">
    **Second Milestone**

    Demonstrates strong product-market fit and adoption. Expected timing: Months 10-12 post-raise.
  </Step>
  <Step title="8x ICO Price: 2M Tokens">
    **Third Milestone**

    Proves scalability and network effects. Expected timing: Year 2.
  </Step>
  <Step title="16x ICO Price: 2M Tokens">
    **Fourth Milestone**

    Indicates major platform integrations and market leadership. Expected timing: Year 2-3.
  </Step>
  <Step title="32x ICO Price: 2M Tokens">
    **Fifth Milestone**

    Signals category dominance and potential unicorn status. Expected timing: Year 3+.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  This structure ensures the team only benefits when **investors benefit**. No time-based unlocks means no incentive to "cash out" early.
</Warning>

## Token Utility

The FynCom token serves multiple functions within the ecosystem:

### 1. Stake Currency

<Card title="Primary Use Case" icon="shield">
  Senders use FynCom tokens to stake when contacting unknown recipients. Stakes are automatically refunded or forfeited based on engagement.
</Card>

**Example Flow:**
```
Sender stakes 0.01 FynCom to send message
↓
Recipient receives message
↓
If 3+ thread responses: Sender receives 0.01 FynCom refund
If <3 responses: 0.008 FynCom to recipient, 0.002 FynCom to treasury
```

### 2. Treasury Revenue

**20% of all forfeited stakes** flow to the FynCom treasury, creating a sustainable revenue model:

<Card>
**Treasury Use Cases:**
- Protocol development and maintenance
- Security audits and bug bounties
- Marketing and user acquisition
- Strategic partnerships and integrations
- Liquidity provision
- Governance and voting mechanisms
</Card>

### 3. Governance Rights

Token holders can vote on:
- Protocol parameter changes (stake amounts, refund criteria)
- Treasury allocation decisions
- Feature prioritization
- Strategic partnership approvals

### 4. Premium Features

Users can stake FynCom tokens to unlock:
- Custom refund criteria
- Advanced analytics dashboard
- Priority customer support
- White-label licensing
- API rate limit increases

### 5. Network Incentives

FynCom tokens reward:
- Early adopters (airdrop campaigns)
- Referral bonuses (invite friends, earn tokens)
- Community contributors (docs, integrations, content)
- Bug bounty hunters

## Revenue Model

FynCom generates revenue through multiple streams:

### Forfeited Stakes (Primary)

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="User Economics">
    **Recipient Share: 80%**
    - Recipients earn when senders don't meet refund criteria
    - Average spam call: $0.04 to recipient ($0.05 × 80%)
    - High-volume recipients can earn significant income

    **Example:**
    - Influencer receives 100 spam messages/day
    - Forfeit rate: 90% (legitimate senders get refunded)
    - Daily earnings: 90 × $0.01 × 80% = **$0.72/day = $263/year**
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Treasury Share: 20%">
    **Protocol Revenue**

    Based on transaction volume:
    - 1M transactions/month @ 50% forfeit rate
    - 500K forfeits × $0.01 = $5,000/month forfeited
    - Treasury: $5,000 × 20% = **$1,000/month**

    At scale (100M transactions/month):
    - 50M forfeits × $0.01 = $500,000/month forfeited
    - Treasury: $500,000 × 20% = **$100,000/month**
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Value Accrual Mechanisms

FynCom token value increases through:

### 1. Network Effects

More users → More transactions → More forfeited stakes → More treasury revenue → More protocol development → More users

### 2. Deflationary Pressure

Potential token burn mechanisms:
- Burn portion of forfeited stakes (reduces supply)
- Buy-back-and-burn using treasury revenue
- Stake slashing for malicious actors

### 3. Yield Generation

Token holders can:
- Stake tokens for governance rewards
- Provide liquidity for trading fees
- Participate in validator networks (future)

### 4. Utility Expansion

As the protocol grows, token utility increases:
- More platforms require FynCom for stakes
- More premium features unlock with tokens
- More governance power for key decisions

</Card>

## Comparison: VC vs MetaDAO

<Tip>
  **Founder Note:** If this were a traditional VC raise, I'd be asking for a $10M cap. Instead, I'm aligning with MetaDAO's model of lower caps and performance-based unlocks—putting my money where my mouth is.
</Tip>

| Aspect | Traditional VC | FynCom MetaDAO |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Raise Amount | $3-5M | $1M minimum |
| Valuation Cap | $10-20M | Lower (MetaDAO standard) |
| Team Tokens | 4-year time vest | Performance-based unlock |
| Investor Protection | Board seats, preferences | Aligned incentives via milestones |
| Transparency | Quarterly reports | On-chain treasury, public metrics |

## Risk Factors

<Warning>
**Investors should consider:**

- **Regulatory Risk:** Crypto regulations evolving; token classification uncertain
- **Market Risk:** Crypto markets volatile; token price may fluctuate
- **Adoption Risk:** Success depends on user adoption and network effects
- **Competition Risk:** Larger players may enter the market
- **Technical Risk:** Smart contract vulnerabilities, blockchain scalability

**Mitigation:** Patent protection, proven traction (500K+ transactions), experienced team, strong technical architecture
</Warning>
