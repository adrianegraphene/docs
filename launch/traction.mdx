### Transaction Breakdown

| Channel | Transactions | Avg Stake | Refund Rate |
|---------|--------------|-----------|-------------|
| Phone Calls | 350K | $0.05 | 15% |

| Emails | 30K | $0.01 | 12% |
| **Total** | **500K** | **$0.036** | **13%** |

## What This Means for Token Value

<Card title="Network Effects Drive Value">
**More Users → More Transactions → More Stakes → More Treasury → More Development → More Users**

With 500K transactions already completed, we've proven the flywheel works. The MetaDAO raise accelerates growth from 10K to 500K users in 12 months—a **50x user increase**.

If transaction volume scales proportionally:
- Current: 500K transactions (10K users)
- Month 12: 25M transactions (500K users)
- **50x transaction growth = significant token utility & value increase**
