  >
    **FynCom's original vision** published: 2021 **note**: this white paper
    reflects FynCom's initial Nano-focused approach. while the core economic
    principles remain the same, we're now building on solana for superior
    scalability and lower transaction costs. a modernized white paper reflecting
    our solana strategy will be published in 2025. **why still relevant**:
    demonstrates the foundational thinking behind economic proof-of-intent and
    refundable payments as a solution to spam economics

    title="API documentation"

    href="/api-reference/introduction"
  >
    **developer resources (coming soon)** SDK and API documentation will be
    published following the beta launch in month 6 of our roadmap. check back
    for: - REST API reference - client libraries (JavaScript, Python, Go) -
    integration guides - code examples - sandbox environment access
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  **about the original white paper**: our initial vision was built around nano
  cryptocurrency for its zero-fee transactions. after extensive research and
  market analysis, we've pivoted to solana which offers superior throughput
  (65,000+ TPS), a thriving ecosystem, and still maintains the low-fee structure
  critical for micro-transactions. the economic principles remain
  identical—refundable stakes, time-based refunds, economic filtering—but the
  infrastructure is now more robust and scalable.
