## about FynCom

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="what is FynCom?" icon="question">
    FynCom creates digital trust by adding refundable crypto micropayments into
    calls, texts, emails & DMs. unknown senders must stake a small refundable
    deposit before recipients are notified. if the recipient engages
    meaningfully, the stake is refunded. if not, it's forfeited to the recipient
    (80%) and FynCom treasury (20%). this creates a marketplace where
    highly-contacted people can monetize their attention while genuine senders
    pay nothing for real conversations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="how is this different from call blocking apps?"
    icon="phone-slash"
  >
    **traditional blockers**: reactive databases of spam numbers, constantly
    playing catch-up **FynCom**: proactive economic barrier that makes spam
    unprofitable regardless of the number used **key difference**: we change the
    economics, not just the detection. legitimate callers get full refunds, so
    there's no "blocking" of valid communications—just an economic filter that
    stops spam at the source.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="why hasn't anyone done this before?" icon="lightbulb">
    **technical barriers**: processing millions of micro-transactions (cents or
    fractions) wasn't feasible until recent blockchain advances **patent
    protection**: we hold US patent 11,310,368 B2 on the Time-Based
    Nano-Transaction System **timing**: the AI agent economy makes this solution
    more critical now than ever before FynCom is uniquely positioned with proven
    technology, patent protection, and perfect market timing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="is FynCom just another crypto project?" icon="coins">
    **no—FynCom is a real business solving a real problem**, with crypto as the
    enabling technology: - 500,000+ actual transactions processed - live mobile
    apps with real users - addressing $30B+ annual fraud problem -
    patent-protected innovation - clear path to profitability crypto provides
    the infrastructure for micro-transactions at scale, but the value is in
    solving spam economics.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## about the technology

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="how does the refund system work?" icon="rotate">
    **automatic and transparent**: 1. unknown sender initiates contact with
    small stake ($0.01-$0.05) 2. system measures engagement (call duration,
    message thread length) 3. if engagement criteria met, stake automatically
    refunds to sender 4. if not met, stake forfeit: 80% to recipient, 20% to
    FynCom treasury **no manual review required**—everything automated based on
    measurable engagement metrics.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="what prevents spammers from just paying the stakes?"
    icon="shield"
  >
    **economics make spam unprofitable**: **example**: robocaller reaching 1,000
    people/day at $0.05/call - if 95% don't answer: $47.50/day in forfeited
    stakes - $1,425/month in costs just to spam - $17,100/year per 1,000 daily
    targets spam only works at zero marginal cost. even tiny stakes make it
    economically impossible at scale.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="why solana instead of ethereum or another blockchain?"
    icon="link"
  >
    **solana advantages**: - **high throughput**: 65,000+ transactions per
    second - **low fees**: fractions of a cent per transaction - **fast
    finality**: sub-second confirmations - **perfect for micro-transactions**:
    designed for high-volume, low-value transactions ethereum's gas fees would
    make $0.01 stakes impractical. solana's design is ideal for our use case.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what if I don't want to use crypto?" icon="hand">
    **FynCom supports traditional payments too**: - credit/debit cards - ACH
    bank transfers - traditional payment rails solana integration is
    optional—users can choose. we bridge both worlds for maximum accessibility.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="how will the agentic AI system work?" icon="robot">
    **automated negotiation between AI agents**: 1. external AI agent wants to
    contact you 2. your FynCom agent automatically negotiates: stake amount,
    refund criteria, timing 3. negotiation based on: sender reputation, your
    preferences, current availability, market rates 4. result: you get only
    high-value communications or get paid protects humans from the coming flood
    of AI-generated contacts without manual filtering.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## about the investment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="what is MetaDAO?" icon="landmark">
    MetaDAO is a decentralized platform for launching and governing crypto
    projects. it provides: - transparent fundraising infrastructure - community
    governance tools - proven track record with successful projects - clear
    legal framework for DAOs learn more at [metadao.fi](https://metadao.fi)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="how much are you raising?" icon="sack-dollar">
    **minimum**: $1,000,000 USD (12 months runway) **personal cap**: $10,000,000
    USD (though we believe higher valuations justified) we're aligning with
    MetaDAO community standards while maintaining realistic expectations.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what will the funds be used for?" icon="chart-pie">
    **$90,000/month budget breakdown**: - engineering & protocol: $50K (55%) -
    marketing & growth: $25K (28%) - R&D & infrastructure: $10K (11%) -
    operations & compliance: $5K (6%) see [team & budget](/team) for detailed
    breakdown.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what is the performance package?" icon="trophy">
    **10M tokens for team, unlocking at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x ICO price**: -
    investors double their money before team earns any performance tokens - each
    unlock requires additional 2x appreciation - aligns team with long-term
    value creation - market-validated success (can't be gamed) see
    [tokenomics](/tokenomics) for full details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="when will I be able to trade my tokens?"
    icon="arrow-right-arrow-left"
  >
    **immediately post-ICO** on MetaDAO's platform and any DEXes where FynCom
    tokens list. **liquidity**: we'll work with MetaDAO and community to ensure
    healthy secondary markets **transparency**: all trading activity visible
    on-chain (post-solana integration)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="how do I participate?" icon="hand-pointer">
    **steps**: 1. review all due diligence materials in these docs 2. wait for
    official FynCom launch announcement on [metadao.fi](https://metadao.fi) 3.
    follow MetaDAO's participation process 4. receive tokens upon successful
    close **stay informed**: follow @Fyn_Com on X/Twitter for launch updates
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## about governance & IP

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="what rights do token holders have?" icon="vote-yea">
    **governance rights**: - vote on major decisions (supermajority required) -
    vote on standard proposals (majority required) - submit proposals (with
    minimum token threshold) - delegate voting power to others **financial
    rights**: - govern treasury usage - receive platform benefits (premium
    features, API access) - participate in any future distributions see
    [governance](/governance) for complete details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="will the patent be transferred to the DAO?"
    icon="file-contract"
  >
    **phased approach**: **immediate** (month 0): domains, code, brand assets
    transfer to DAO **roadmap** (months 1-9): patent strategy evaluation with
    three options: - exclusive perpetual license to DAO - full transfer to DAO -
    co-ownership structure **DAO decides**: governance vote on preferred
    structure (months 3-6) **rationale**: thoughtful approach protects DAO value
    while maintaining strategic flexibility see [IP strategy](/ip-strategy) for
    full details.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="why not transfer the patent immediately?" icon="clock">
    **practical considerations**: - DAO legal structures still evolving, patent
    law is traditional - exclusive license gives DAO full benefits immediately -
    maintains optionality for future VC if needed for massive scale - allows
    proper legal entity structuring **commitment**: regardless of ownership
    structure, DAO has full operational use of patented technology
    **transparency**: full IP roadmap disclosed, DAO votes on final structure
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what if I disagree with team decisions?" icon="hand">
    **governance process**: 1. **raise concerns** in community forums/Discord 2.
    **submit counter-proposal** if you have alternative approach 3. **DAO
    votes** on competing proposals 4. **majority decides** the direction
    **extreme cases**: DAO can vote to replace leadership (supermajority
    required) token holders have real power to shape direction.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## about risks & competition

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="what are the main risks?" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **primary risks**: - **adoption risk**: users/businesses may not adopt the
    solution - **competition**: larger companies could enter the space -
    **regulatory**: crypto regulations continue evolving - **technical**:
    blockchain integration challenges - **market**: crypto volatility impacts
    token value see [full risk disclosure](/risks) for comprehensive analysis
    and mitigation strategies.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what if a big tech company copies this?" icon="building">
    **competitive advantages**: - **patent protection**: US 11,310,368 B2
    protects core mechanism - **first-mover**: we're already live with users and
    transactions - **DAO structure**: more aligned than corporate alternative -
    **crypto-native**: blockchain integration gives us technical edge
    **reality**: big tech has been trying to solve spam for decades with limited
    success. our economic approach is fundamentally different.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="what if people don't want to pay to contact others?"
    icon="comment-slash"
  >
    **they don't have to**: - **existing contacts**: whitelist allows free
    communication - **engagement refunds**: genuine conversations cost nothing
    (stakes refunded) - **only spam pays**: only unwanted contacts forfeit
    stakes **psychology**: small stake proves seriousness. recipients know you
    valued them enough to stake, increasing response rates.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="what if user growth is slower than projected?"
    icon="chart-line-down"
  >
    **mitigation strategies**: - **lean budget**: $90K/month is efficient,
    extends runway - **reallocation**: shift spend from underperforming to
    winning channels - **pivot capability**: DAO can adjust strategy based on
    data - **multiple revenue streams**: not dependent on single user base
    **proven execution**: we've already hit 500K+ transactions, demonstrating
    product-market fit
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    B2 ✅ proven technology at scale with real users ✅ treasury system
    demonstrating revenue model **next**: geographic expansion, SDK/API, solana
    integration, AI agents
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion
    title="how will you compete with free solutions?"
    icon="dollar-sign"
  >
    **free solutions don't work—that's why spam persists**: - call blockers:
    reactive, miss new numbers, false positives - carrier filters: inconsistent,
    limited effectiveness - AI detection: arms race, expensive, privacy concerns
    **FynCom isn't competing with free solutions—we're replacing them with
    something that actually works.** **pricing**: end users don't pay
    subscription. platform sustains itself from forfeited spam stakes. genuine
    senders get refunds. everyone wins except spammers.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## about timing & future

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="why invest now?" icon="clock">
    **perfect timing**: - spam/scam crisis worsening (public frustration high) -
    blockchain tech now mature enough for micro-transactions - AI agents
    emerging (creating urgent need for human-agent economic protocols) -
    first-mover advantage with patent protection - proven product with real
    traction **ground floor**: participating before major growth phase
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what happens after the first 12 months?" icon="forward">
    **year 2 priorities** (pending DAO approval): - national US expansion (all
    major metros) - major platform partnerships (email, messaging, social) - AI
    agent ecosystem opens to third parties - international market exploration -
    path to profitability or follow-on fundraising **DAO decides**: year 2
    strategy will be voted on by token holders
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="what's the exit strategy?" icon="door-open">
    **multiple paths**: - **sustainable business**: become profitable, ongoing
    DAO operations - **acquisition**: potential acquirer sees value in user
    base/technology - **IPO**: if scale warrants, transition to public company -
    **perpetual DAO**: continue as decentralized protocol indefinitely **token
    holders decide**: any major exit would require DAO governance approval
