## MetaDAO framework

FynCom leverages MetaDAO's proven decentralized governance platform to ensure transparent, community-driven decision making.

</CardGroup>

## governance principles

our DAO operates on core principles that balance decentralization with effective execution:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="transparency">
    **commitment**: all significant decisions, financials, and operations
    visible to token holders **implementation**: - monthly financial reports -
    quarterly strategy reviews - real-time treasury visibility (on-chain after
    month 9) - open proposal discussions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="efficiency">
    **commitment**: governance enables execution, doesn't paralyze it
    **implementation**: - clear delegation to team for operational matters - DAO
    votes on strategic direction, not daily tactics - reasonable voting periods
    (not too long) - supermajority for major changes only
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="alignment">
    **commitment**: decisions benefit all token holders equally
    **implementation**: - no special voting classes - proportional voting based
    on token holdings - performance package aligns team with token holders -
    anti-whale mechanisms if needed (DAO decides)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="evolution">
    **commitment**: governance improves based on experience **implementation**:
    - periodic governance reviews - ability to amend governance rules - learning
    from other DAOs - pragmatic adjustments as we grow
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## decision categories

different types of decisions have different governance requirements:

### major strategic decisions (supermajority required)

**threshold**: 66%+ of votes must approve

**examples**:

- changes to core protocol economics (stake amounts, refund criteria, treasury split)
- patent transfer strategy and IP licensing
- treasury allocation exceeding $100,000
- major partnership agreements with revenue sharing
- changes to governance rules themselves
- fundraising or token issuance
- merger/acquisition discussions

**rationale**: major decisions need broad consensus to protect all stakeholders

### standard proposals (simple majority)

**threshold**: 50%+ of votes must approve

**examples**:

- feature prioritization and product roadmap
- marketing budget allocation and strategy
- hiring key positions (VP level and above)
- community grant programs (under $100K total)
- vendor selection for major services
- geographic expansion decisions
- open source strategy decisions

**rationale**: strategic direction should reflect majority will while allowing progress

### operational decisions (team execution)

**threshold**: team discretion with transparency

**examples**:

- day-to-day product development
- minor feature releases
- individual hiring decisions (below VP level)
- tactical marketing execution
- vendor selection for routine services
- customer support policies
- bug fixes and maintenance

**rationale**: team needs autonomy to execute efficiently; DAO oversight through regular reporting

## proposal process

how token holders can initiate and vote on proposals:

<Steps>
  <Step title="proposal submission">
    **who**: any token holder meeting minimum threshold (TBD, likely 0.1-1% of
    supply) **requirements**: - clear description of proposal - rationale and
    expected impact - implementation plan - budget implications - success
    metrics **format**: standardized template on governance platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="discussion period">
    **duration**: 7 days **purpose**: community debate, questions, refinements
    **platform**: MetaDAO forum, Discord, community calls **amendments**:
    proposer can revise based on feedback
  </Step>
  <Step title="voting period">
    **duration**: 7 days **eligibility**: all token holders as of snapshot date
    (beginning of discussion period) **mechanism**: token-weighted voting
    on-chain (post-solana integration) **results**: transparent, publicly
    viewable
  </Step>
  <Step title="execution">
    **if approved**: team implements within specified timeline **progress
    updates**: regular reports to DAO on implementation **accountability**: team
    explains any deviations from approved plan **completion**: final report on
    outcomes and learnings
  </Step>
</Steps>

## voting mechanics

### voting power

<ParamField path="calculation" type="formula">
  voting power = FynCom tokens held
</ParamField>

**one token = one vote**: simple, transparent, proportional

**snapshot timing**: voting power determined at start of discussion period (prevents vote buying)

**delegation**: token holders can delegate votes to other addresses (optional feature)

### quorum requirements

to prevent low-turnout outcomes:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="major decisions" icon="users">
    **quorum**: 33% of circulating supply must participate **rationale**:
    critical decisions need meaningful community engagement **if not met**:
    proposal fails, can be re-submitted after improvements
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="standard proposals" icon="user-group">
    **quorum**: 20% of circulating supply must participate **rationale**:
    balance accessibility with legitimacy **if not met**: proposal fails, can be
    re-submitted with better outreach
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### vote delegation

token holders can focus on areas of interest:

- **delegate votes**: assign your voting power to another address
- **revoke anytime**: delegation is non-binding, revocable instantly
- **selective**: delegate for specific proposals or generally
- **transparent**: all delegations visible on-chain

example: technical experts could attract delegations for technology proposals, business-focused holders for partnerships

## DAO structure

### token holder assembly

**composition**: all FynCom token holders

**role**: ultimate decision-making authority

**power**: vote on proposals per governance rules

**communication**: MetaDAO platform, Discord, monthly community calls

### core team

**composition**: founding team and key hires

**role**: execute approved strategy and manage operations

**accountability**: regular reporting to token holders

**compensation**: per team budget plus performance package

**removal**: DAO can vote to replace leadership if needed (supermajority)

### working groups (future)

as DAO matures, specialized working groups may form:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="technical working group" icon="code">
    **focus**: product roadmap, SDK/API, technical partnerships **members**:
    technical token holders, developers, engineers
  </Card>
  <Card title="growth working group" icon="chart-line">
    **focus**: marketing strategy, geographic expansion, user acquisition
    **members**: marketing/growth-focused token holders
  </Card>
  <Card title="treasury working group" icon="vault">
    **focus**: financial management, investment strategy, budgeting **members**:
    finance-savvy token holders
  </Card>
  <Card title="governance working group" icon="landmark">
    **focus**: governance improvements, dispute resolution, process optimization
    **members**: governance-interested token holders
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**note**: working groups advise and propose; they don't have independent decision authority

## treasury management

transparent, DAO-controlled financial operations:

### treasury sources

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="fundraise proceeds">
    **initial**: $1M minimum raise (target: up to $10M) **usage**: per approved
    budget ($90K/month for 12 months) **accountability**: monthly burn rate
    reporting
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="platform revenue">
    **ongoing**: 20% of forfeited stakes **growth**: scales with user base and
    transaction volume **allocation**: per DAO governance (reinvest, distribute,
    reserve, etc.)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="SDK/API licensing">
    **future**: enterprise licensing fees **potential**: significant revenue
    from platform integrations **allocation**: DAO governs usage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="other income">
    **potential**: premium features, partnerships, IP licensing
    **transparency**: all income visible on-chain (post-month 9) **control**:
    DAO decides allocation
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### treasury visibility

<Steps>
  <Step title="months 1-6: traditional accounting">
    **reporting**: monthly financial statements to DAO **format**: standard
    accounting (income, expenses, runway) **transparency**: published via
    MetaDAO platform
  </Step>
  <Step title="month 7-9: hybrid">
    **transition**: solana integration brings on-chain treasury **mix**: some
    funds on-chain, some traditional banking **tracking**: dual reporting during
    transition
  </Step>
  <Step title="month 9+: on-chain">
    **primary**: treasury on solana, visible in real-time **transparency**:
    anyone can audit treasury at any time **exceptions**: some fiat accounts may
    remain for operational reasons
  </Step>
</Steps>
