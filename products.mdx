## Time-Based Nano-Transaction System

the core technology powering FynCom's solution, protected by US patent 11,310,368 B2.

### how it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="stake placement">
    when an unknown sender initiates contact, a small refundable stake is
    required: - **phone calls**: default $0.05 - **messages**: default $0.01 -
    **customizable**: premium users set their own rates
  </Step>
  <Step title="engagement measurement">
    the system automatically measures meaningful engagement: - **calls**:
    conversation duration (default 25 seconds for refund) - **messages**: thread
    response count (default 3 responses for refund) - **emails**: similar
    thread-based measurement
  </Step>
  <Step title="automatic settlement">
    based on engagement, the system automatically: - **refunds** the sender if
    engagement criteria are met - **forfeit stakes** if criteria aren't met,
    distributing: - 80% to recipient (monetizing their attention) - 20% to
    FynCom treasury (platform sustainability)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### technical advantages

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="real-time processing" icon="bolt">
    stakes are held and released in real-time based on engagement metrics. no
    manual review, no delays.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="blockchain-ready" icon="link">
    designed for integration with multiple blockchain networks. current
    implementation supports traditional payments; Solana integration planned for
    months 7-9.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="scalable micro-transactions" icon="chart-line">
    efficiently processes millions of nano-transactions (cents or fractions)
    without prohibitive fees.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="privacy-preserving" icon="shield">
    engagement measurement doesn't require content analysis. system only
    measures duration/frequency, not message content.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="cross-platform" icon="layer-group">
    works across phone calls, SMS, email, and social media DMs. unified economic
    layer for all digital communication.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

    platform operators - white-label options for branded implementations
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="business applications">
    **target integrations**: CRM systems, customer support platforms, scheduling
    tools **capabilities**: - qualify inbound leads with economic signals -
    monetize consultation requests - protect high-value time (executives,
    experts, consultants) - integration with existing billing systems
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="developer tools">

    documentation and examples
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### API preview

while full documentation will be available post-fundraise, here's a conceptual preview:

```javascript
// example: require stake for API endpoint access
const fyncom = require("@fyncom/sdk");

app.post(
  "/premium-contact",
  fyncom.requireStake({
    amount: 0.05,
    refundCriteria: {
      responseTime: 3600, // refund if response within 1 hour
      minEngagement: 300, // or if engagement > 5 minutes
    },
  }),
  async (req, res) => {
    // your premium endpoint logic
    // stake is automatically managed
  }
);
```

## agentic AI negotiation system

the next frontier: protecting humans from the AI communications flood.

### the challenge

as autonomous AI agents become ubiquitous:

- **volume explosion**: AI can send thousands of personalized contacts per second
- **sophistication increase**: AI-generated messages are increasingly indistinguishable from human communication
- **human overwhelm**: people can't manually filter this volume

### the FynCom agent solution

we're building an AI agent that acts as your personal negotiator:

<Steps>
  <Step title="agent-to-agent negotiation">
    when an external AI agent wants to contact you, your FynCom agent
    negotiates: - appropriate stake amount based on context - refund criteria
    that match your preferences - timing and urgency considerations
  </Step>
  <Step title="intelligent filtering">
    your FynCom agent learns your preferences: - what types of contacts you
    value - when you're available vs. busy - which senders have good reputation
    - market rates for your attention
  </Step>
  <Step title="optimal outcomes">
    automatically ensures you either: - receive only high-value communications -
    get paid appropriately for your time and attention - maintain control
    without manual intervention
  </Step>
</Steps>

### development timeline

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="months 10-11" icon="code">
    **core development** agent negotiation protocol, preference learning,
    reputation systems
  </Card>
  <Card title="month 12" icon="flask">
    **beta testing** controlled rollout with early users, refinement based on

### research foundation

our approach is informed by cutting-edge research in virtual agent economies:

<Accordion
  title="Google DeepMind: virtual agent economies"
  icon="graduation-cap"
>
  recent research (arXiv:2509.10147v1) explores how autonomous agents create
  economic systems. FynCom positions itself at the intersection of human-agent
  interaction, providing the economic protocol layer.
