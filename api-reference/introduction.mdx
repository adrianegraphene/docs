## technical preview

while full documentation will be available with the beta release, here's a conceptual preview:

```javascript
// example: require stake for premium endpoint
const fyncom = require('@fyncom/sdk');

app.post('/contact-expert', fyncom.requireStake({
  amount: 0.05,  // $0.05 stake
  refundCriteria: {
    responseTime: 3600,  // refund if expert responds within 1 hour
    minEngagement: 300    // or if conversation exceeds 5 minutes
  }
}), async (req, res) => {
  // your endpoint logic
  // stake automatically managed by FynCom
});
```

<Note>
  actual API syntax and capabilities will be finalized during development. this is illustrative only.
