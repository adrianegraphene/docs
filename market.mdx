## competitive landscape

FynCom's approach is fundamentally different from existing solutions:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="call blocking apps">
    **competitors**: Truecaller, RoboKiller, Nomorobo, Hiya **their approach**:
    database of known spam numbers, crowdsourced reporting, AI detection
    **limitations**: - reactive, not preventive - false positives block
    legitimate calls - no economic disincentive for spammers - subscription
    revenue model **FynCom advantage**: economic barrier prevents spam before it
    happens, legitimate callers get through, self-funding model
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="carrier solutions">
    **competitors**: AT&T Call Protect, Verizon Call Filter, T-Mobile Scam
    Shield **their approach**: network-level filtering, STIR/SHAKEN verification
    **limitations**: - limited effectiveness against sophisticated spammers -
    inconsistent across carriers - doesn't address root economic problem
    **FynCom advantage**: carrier-agnostic, works across all networks, changes
    economics
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="email filtering">
    **competitors**: Gmail spam filter, Outlook junk mail, third-party services
    **their approach**: machine learning, sender reputation, content analysis
    **limitations**: - false positives lose important emails - arms race with
    spammers - privacy concerns with content scanning **FynCom advantage**:
    economic filtering without content analysis, preserves privacy, self-funding
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="no AI agent competition">
    **competitors**: none significant **market status**: emerging, no
    established solutions for human-AI agent economic protocol **FynCom
    advantage**: first-mover opportunity, patent protection, proven technology
    foundation
  </Tab>

- **monthly forfeited stakes**: $285,000
- **FynCom share (20%)**: $57,000/month
- **recipient rewards (80%)**: $228,000/month

at scale (10M users): $570K/month platform revenue + SDK licensing + premium features
