## restoring trust to digital communication

today, spam, scams, and AI-generated fraud thrive because it costs bad actors nothing to reach everyone. FynCom solves this by introducing an **economic proof-of-intent protocol** where every communication from an unknown sender requires a small, refundable stake.

## proven technology, real results

FynCom isn't just another crypto project—it's a proven solution with real-world adoption:

## how it works

FynCom creates a marketplace where unknown senders stake refundable deposits before recipients are notified:

  <Card

    icon="phone"
  >
    $0.05 stake, refunded after 25 seconds of conversation. no charge if call isn't connected.
  </Card>
  <Card

    icon="envelope"
  >
    $0.01 stake, refunded after 3 thread responses. genuine senders get their money back.
  </Card>
</Columns>

if the recipient doesn't engage long enough, stakes are forfeited at an 80:20 rate to the recipient and FynCom's treasury—turning spam into revenue.

## the agentic AI opportunity

as autonomous AI agents proliferate, humans need protection from massive inbound communications. FynCom is building the personal "negotiator" that automatically handles stake negotiations, ensuring humans get genuine communications or more cash in their wallets.
