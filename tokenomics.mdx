  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## token distribution

the total token supply and distribution will be finalized during fundraising based on investor participation and MetaDAO structure.

### allocation framework

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="investor allocation">
    **ICO participants**: majority of initial distribution - direct purchase
    through MetaDAO platform - proportional to investment amount - immediate
    liquidity (subject to platform rules) - full governance rights from day one
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="performance package">
    **team incentives**: 10,000,000 tokens - aligns team with long-term value
    creation - unlocks at 2x, 4x, 8x, 16x, and 32x ICO price - 5 equal tranches
    of 2,000,000 tokens each - cannot be gamedâ€”requires real market appreciation
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="treasury reserve">
    **platform development**: allocation for ongoing operations - ecosystem
    development grants - partnership incentives - community rewards programs -
    emergency reserves **governance**: DAO-controlled, transparent usage
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="liquidity provision">
    **market making**: ensuring healthy secondary markets - DEX liquidity pools
    - market making partnerships - trading accessibility - price stability
    mechanisms
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Note>
  exact distribution percentages will be determined by final fundraising
  structure and MetaDAO requirements. all distributions will be transparent and
  published prior to ICO.
</Note>

## performance package details

the performance package creates extraordinary alignment between team and investors:

### tranche structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="tranche 1: 2x ICO price">
    **unlocks**: 2,000,000 tokens **requirements**: FynCom token trades at 2x
    the initial ICO price **team must deliver**: strong user growth,
    product-market fit, clear path to sustainability
  </Step>
  <Step title="tranche 2: 4x ICO price">
    **unlocks**: 2,000,000 tokens **requirements**: 4x ICO price (2x
    appreciation from previous unlock) **team must deliver**: significant market
    penetration, partnership success, revenue growth
  </Step>
  <Step title="tranche 3: 8x ICO price">
    **unlocks**: 2,000,000 tokens **requirements**: 8x ICO price (2x
    appreciation from previous unlock) **team must deliver**: market leadership
    position, platform ecosystem, sustainable economics
  </Step>
  <Step title="tranche 4: 16x ICO price">
    **unlocks**: 2,000,000 tokens **requirements**: 16x ICO price (2x
    appreciation from previous unlock) **team must deliver**: dominant market
    position, international expansion, major partnerships
  </Step>
  <Step title="tranche 5: 32x ICO price">
    **unlocks**: 2,000,000 tokens (final tranche) **requirements**: 32x ICO
    price (2x appreciation from previous unlock) **team must deliver**:
    category-defining success, massive adoption, clear path to IPO or major
    acquisition
  </Step>
</Steps>

### why this structure works

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="investors win first" icon="trophy">
    before the team earns any performance tokens, investors have already doubled
    their money (2x). every subsequent unlock requires investors to see
    additional 2x returns.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="long-term commitment" icon="hourglass">
    reaching 32x requires sustained execution over years, not quick flips. team
    is incentivized for marathon, not sprint.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="market-validated success" icon="chart-line">
    unlocks depend on real market prices, not internal metrics that can be
    manipulated. success must be recognized by broader market.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="proportional rewards" icon="balance-scale">
    equal tranches mean team earns proportionally at each level. no massive
    payout early that removes incentive to continue.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## governance rights

token holders have meaningful control over protocol direction:

### voting power

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="major decisions">
    **requires**: supermajority (66%+ approval) **examples**: - changes to core
    protocol economics - treasury allocation > $100K - partnership agreements
    with revenue sharing - patent/IP licensing deals - major strategic pivots
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="standard proposals">
    **requires**: simple majority (50%+ approval) **examples**: - feature
    prioritization - default stake amount changes - community grant approvals -
    marketing budget allocation - hiring key positions
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="operational decisions">
    **requires**: team execution with transparency **examples**: - day-to-day
    operations - minor product updates - routine hiring - vendor selection -
    tactical marketing **note**: major changes still require DAO approval
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### proposal process

<Steps>
  <Step title="submission">
    any token holder can submit a proposal with minimum threshold (TBD based on
    final distribution)
  </Step>
  <Step title="discussion period">
    7-day community discussion on proposal merits, concerns, alternatives
  </Step>
  <Step title="voting period">7-day voting window, token-weighted votes</Step>
  <Step title="execution">
    if approved, team executes within specified timeline. progress reports to
    DAO.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## value accrual mechanisms

how tokens may appreciate in value as platform grows:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="platform revenue growth" icon="arrow-trend-up">
    as user base grows, forfeited stakes increase. 20% of forfeited stakes flow
    to FynCom treasury, governed by token holders.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="utility expansion" icon="puzzle-piece">
    more use cases for tokens (stakes, premium features, API access, agent
    economy) increase demand.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="ecosystem partnerships" icon="network-wired">
    as SDK/API integrations grow, token becomes valuable across multiple
    platforms beyond just KarmaCall.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="scarcity & buybacks" icon="coins">
    potential for DAO-approved token buybacks using treasury funds, reducing
    circulating supply.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="governance value" icon="landmark">
    as platform grows more valuable, governance rights become more meaningful
    and sought-after.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## token economics example

illustrating how platform growth drives token utility:

### scenario: 1 million active users

**assumptions**:

- 1M active users
- 10 spam attempts per user per month
- $0.03 average stake
- 95% forfeiture rate (spam doesn't engage)

**monthly economics**:

- total forfeited stakes: $285,000
- recipient rewards (80%): $228,000
- platform revenue (20%): $57,000

**annual platform revenue**: $684,000

**token implications**:

- treasury accumulates $684K annually
- tokens govern treasury usage
- utility increases (more stakes using tokens)
- demand increases (more users want premium features)
- governance becomes more valuable

### scenario: 10 million active users (10x)

**scaled monthly economics**:

- total forfeited stakes: $2,850,000
- recipient rewards (80%): $2,280,000
- platform revenue (20%): $570,000

**annual platform revenue**: $6,840,000

**plus**: SDK/API licensing, premium subscriptions, partnership revenue

at scale, the platform becomes significantly cash-flow positive, with token holders governing a substantial treasury.

## comparison to traditional equity

why tokens > traditional equity for this project:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="liquidity">
    **tokens**: immediate liquidity on secondary markets post-ICO **equity**:
    typically illiquid until IPO or acquisition (5-10+ years)
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="governance">
    **tokens**: direct voting on proposals, transparent on-chain **equity**:
    indirect through board, often diluted by VCs
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="utility">
    **tokens**: actual use in platform (stakes, features, API) **equity**:
    purely financial claim
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="transparency">
    **tokens**: on-chain treasury, public metrics, real-time tracking
    **equity**: quarterly reports, limited visibility
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="alignment">
    **tokens**: performance package ensures team-investor alignment **equity**:
    options can misalign (prefer exit over growth)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## risks & considerations

transparent disclosure of tokenomics risks:

<Warning>
  **volatility**: crypto tokens can be highly volatile. value may fluctuate
  significantly.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **regulatory uncertainty**: token regulations continue evolving. changes in
  law could impact token utility or liquidity.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **platform adoption risk**: token value depends on platform success. if user
  growth disappoints, token value may suffer.
</Warning>

<Warning>
  **competition**: competitors may impact platform growth and token value.
</Warning>

see [full risk disclosures](/risks) for comprehensive analysis.
